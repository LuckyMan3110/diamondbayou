            	<p><span>Diamonds.</span> Almost any diamond will look impressive under the bright spotlights of a jewelry store, but a rare few have the unique combination 
of precise cut, shape, and angles to hold their brilliance in more natural lighting situations. Beyond the basic "4 Cs" (carat, color, clarity, cut/shape) 
used to determine a diamond's overall quality, there is another level of excellence that involves the symmetry and reflective quality of a 
diamond's cut, and potentially enhances all of the 4 Cs. This reflective quality determines how well a diamond "performs," in other words, how 
well it reflects light under all lighting conditions and situations.
                </p>
                <p>On our Web site, you'll find loose diamonds and diamond jewelry set with the finest performing diamonds available in the world, as well as 
information for your personal diamond education. Our diamonds are certified by both the AGS (American Gem Society) and the GIA 
(Gemological Institute of America), organizations known for their strict grading standards. Whether personally designed and overseen by master 
cutter, Yadegar Diamonds, for his Signature Line, or hand-selected by Yadegar from trusted suppliers for his Select Line, our diamonds offer you a range of 
choices for your needs. Our diamonds are separated roughly into two main categories</p>
			<p><span>Yadegar Diamonds Signature:</span> For the discriminating buyer seeking the finest cut and polished diamonds available, Yadegar Diamonds Signature diamonds 
exceed all expectations. Each displays a unique brilliance and fire that reveals the distinct beauty and personality of the stone, and gives voice to 
the inner essence of the diamond through its contrast, brightness and scintillation.</p>

       <p> Yadegar Diamonds Signature diamonds go beyond the ideal diamond standard in terms of consistency, precision and cutting design to achieve the 
        level of "super ideal" in visual balance and performance under any lighting condition. These signature diamonds are skillfully shaped to ideal 
        mathematical proportions, using a complex formula in which every facet is placed at the precise angle to create the perfect balance between 
        maximum brilliance (return of light to the eye) and the optimum scattering of light, or "fire" (this is the prism effect that separates white light 
        into its spectral colors). Over the past 12 years, Yadgear has produced more than 12,500 of these super ideal diamonds. Today they are prized and 
        widely appreciated around the world for their outstanding beauty.</p>
        
        <p><span>Yadegar Diamonds Select:</span> Yadegar also carefully analyzes and selects diamonds from a variety of local and international suppliers to offer to our 
        customers. These select stones have been cut with excellent precision and come from "conflict free" areas of the world (areas where the local 
        population isn't exploited in the mining of the stones). Diamonds and jewelry that meet Yadegar's strict "Select" quality standards exhibit 
        outstanding cut, color and clarity, as demonstrated by their light performance. And, for the diamond buyer, they represent the optimum balance 
        between performance and value.</p>
        
        <p><span>Lifetime Upgrade Policy.</span> With the purchase of Yadegar Diamonds Signature Hearts and Arrows certified diamonds, we offer a unique Lifetime Upgrade
         Policy. This enables you to apply the value of your current Yadegar Diamonds Signature diamond toward a new purchase. You can apply the original 
        purchase price (less shipping) towards your upgrade and simply pay the difference.</p>
