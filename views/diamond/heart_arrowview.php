                    <p>When selecting a diamond, you have many choices and options. Beyond the basic "4 Cs" (carat, color, clarity, cut/shape) used to 
measure a diamond's quality, there is another level of excellence and perfection that involves the symmetry and reflective quality 
of a diamond's cut - another "C" that affects and potentially enhances all the others.  The cut determines how well a diamond 
"performs," how well it reflects light under a variety of lighting conditions and situations. Practically any stone will look impressive 
under the bright spotlights of a jewelry store, but a rare few have the unique combination of precise cut, shape, and angles to 
hold their brilliance in more natural lighting situations. </p>

<p>This is what distinguishes Yadegar Diamonds Signature Hearts and Arrows Diamonds – diamonds that embody the perfect marriage of 
brilliance, fire and dazzling scintillation, unrivaled by ordinary diamonds. Where words end, your Yadegar Diamonds Signature Hearts 
and Arrows diamond will carry on, adding new, unending expressions of your love. </p>

                    <div class="content_row">
                    <p>The ideal cut diamond is cut to "ideal" mathematical proportions in which every facet is placed at exact angles to create an ideal 
balance between optimum brilliance (return of light to the eye) and the scattering of light, or "fire" (this is the prism effect that 
separates white light into its spectral colors).  To achieve this optimum reflection and refraction of light, the cutter must be willing 
to sacrifice valuable carat weight to yield a smaller diamond though with superior beauty.</p>

<p>The hearts and arrows cut was developed in the 1980s by Japanese cutters who produced diamonds cut so exactly that the facet 
reflections created overlapping, kaleidoscopic patterns when seen through reflecting viewers. These diamonds created a visual 
pattern of eight "hearts" visible through the pavilion (the bottom, or pointed section of the diamond) and eight "arrows" when 
the stone was viewed in the table-up position.  This visual phenomenon was nicknamed the "Cupid effect," and these diamonds 
became known in the trade as "hearts and arrows."</p>

                        and light performance, based on five generations of experience, helped them achieve a
