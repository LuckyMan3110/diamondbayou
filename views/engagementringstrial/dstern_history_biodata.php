                    <div>David was trained in London, England under expert European Jewelers. After a 5 year apprenticeship, He learned how to hand make fine jewelry from scratch in the traditional fashion developed over many centuries, He opened his first business in 1970. </div><br>
                    <div>Within 5 years of hard work and determination to make his mark, he had achieved the opening of 3 retail stores in London, including one in Hatton Garden (the British version of 47th Street in NYC which is the US Manufacturing and Diamond Center) and two others in Central London. In addition, David has a thriving manufacturing business selling his one of a kind designs to retail jewelers throughout the UK. As a nationally known jewelry designer, he also regularly appraised antique, period and estate jewelry.</div>
                    <div>Looking for an opportunity to become more exposed to new and innovative jewelry ideas, David emigrated to the US in 1976. His first priority was educating himself with the American way of doing business. David started to buy and sell antique and estate jewelry. He traveled the US participating in the estate jewelry show circuit to establish new contacts and start to build a reputation for his expertise in that field, while at the same time developing his latest collection of original jewelry designs. After achieving the above, David settled in Miami. He opened his first US store in downtown Miami in the Seybold Building (the central building in the jewelry district in South Florida) It featured his original designs and his unique antique jewelry collection gathered while touring the various antique shows.
