His personality is welcoming and genuine. I purchased a  stunningnew ring  during my visit,as well. It is his design, his imagination, and his expertise that I were drawn to immediately.  I am very lucky to have found David on the Internet . He is a "gem" ! I recommend him highly and without any reservations.</p>

My first experience with David designing jewelry for me was 12 years ago and I am still a loyal and very happy customer! Recently I had David design new jewelry pieces for me using stones and jewelry pieces from now deceased family members. I am beyond pleased with the results and now I have heirloom pieces of jewelry to pass onto my heirs. But in the meantime I am enjoying them! Go see David today!!</p>

                        <p class="review-body">If you want friendly and professional help with jewelry go to David Stern Fine Jewelry in Boca Raton, FL. When I was buying an engagement ring for my fiancee I wanted something unique and tasteful and one of a kind. First I visited all the big brand stores like Jared etc. their models were either too simple, boring or way too expensive. There was no room for real creativity and everything looked mass produced. 
                          
                          Walking in to Davids store he asked me some questions on what I wanted and then right away showed me many different customization options for a unique ring. He had some great pieces in all price points. David also made me realize that custom jewelry is not just something for the over the top wealthy buyers. They make and customize their pieces in house and have a talented goldsmith working for them. For the same money that you would spend elsewhere, with David, you can get a unique piece with a peace of mind that you are getting quality gold and jewels from a respectable seller . 
                          
                          The great thing with associating with David is that you get the knowledge of a true professional with a lifetime of experience. He does everything from appraisals to diamond shopping for you and guarantees the quality of all of his pieces. He immediately told me to come back if there was any problems with the ring and where to get the best insurance etc. 
                          
                          Since knowing David I have learned a lot about jewelry and now I have a lot more confidence about buying.</p>

I also love that this is his (David's) store and is his work. These are not that same mass produced pieces that every other person will have. My fiancé got my custom ring from David and its a stunner! I get so many compliments and so many people admire the elegance, beauty and uniqueness of my engagement ring. David will always have our business.</p>
