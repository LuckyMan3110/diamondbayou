        <div>Johnny Dang has single handedly changed the way entertainers today wear jewelry. Known as "The Jeweler to the Stars", Dang created eccentric jeweled pieces that accessorized and defined the lifestyles of popular Hip Hop stars today. Best known for popularizing diamond encrusted mouth pieces referred to as "Grillz", Dang influenced the Grammy Award winning Hip Hop collaboration of Nelly and Paul Wall. Nelly and Paul Wall's song "Grillz" colorfully elaborated on the jewelry phenomenon that was taking over the entertainment industry.  From Paris Hilton and Hugh Heffner to P.Diddy and Kanye West, everybody was rocking a grill!</div><br><br>
